# Go go go

Recreation of the Waddington's game "Go" in Go, as a server.

The original game is maybe still under copyright, so there's no board here. Overall, this probably won't make much sense if you don't know the game.

```
make server.run
make creategameone
xdg-open 'http://localhost:1235/?gameId=one&name=me&colour=blue'
```

# Go go go

Recreation of the Waddington's game "Go" in Go, as a server.

The original game is maybe still under copyright, so it's not hosted anywhere.
Also, I'm not uploading the rule book etc.

```
make server.run
xdg-open 'http://localhost:1235/play/go/'
```

Then create a game, the server will make links for each player,
